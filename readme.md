#### "Match Them Tunes!"
  This is the game I created for my first project at General Assembly, and the goal is match all pairs that are hidden on the board. There are currently two different levels, whereas the first is only based your memory of sounds, whereas the second level might give you a slight advantage if you know your movies!



### Getting started

## Local
  To run this game locally you need to clone or download the whole project from Github.

## Online
  You can play this game on heroku, [here](https://stormy-sea-23679.herokuapp.com/).


### Technologies used

  For this game I've used the following technologies:
  - HTML5
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  - jQuery
  - Git
  - Github
  - Heroku


### Challenges faced
  Biggest challenge or frustration I met was when I wanted to implement pictures aswell, instead of sound only. Since my code only was meant for sounds at the beginning, it took what felt like ages to make it compatible for pictures aswell.

  


### Ideas for new features


### Acknowledgments
  Thanks to my classmates for help and inspiration when I've been stuck and frustrated!
