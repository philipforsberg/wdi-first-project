## "Match Them Tunes!"
  This is the game I created for my first project at General Assembly, and the goal is match all pairs that are hidden on the board. There are currently two different levels, whereas the first is only based your memory of sounds, whereas the second level might give you a slight advantage if you know your movies!



### Getting started
#### Local
  To run this game locally you need to clone or download the whole project from Github.

#### Online
  You can play this game on heroku, [here](https://stormy-sea-23679.herokuapp.com/).


### Technologies used

  For this game I've used the following technologies:
  - HTML5
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  - jQuery
  - Git
  - Github
  - Heroku


### Challenges faced
  Biggest challenge or frustration I met was when I wanted to implement pictures aswell, instead of sound only. Since my code only was meant for sounds at the beginning, it took what felt like ages to make it compatible for pictures aswell.


### Ideas for new features / Things that are not done yet
  For things I haven't yet managed to implement in the game, I can think of a few things. For example a high-score board, a reset button that only does a soft reset and not reloads the whole page and adding animations for the outcomes(win or lose) and more.
  DRYing up my code is also high up on the list, considering there are numerous places in my code that I've repeated myself(one for each level basically).

  I also might add a third level, but this one might only sounds, or maybe try to randomize it so that it can be either sounds or pictures. So that on one board the pairs can consist of two of the same sounds, two of the same picture, or one of each.

### Acknowledgments
  Thanks to my classmates for help and inspiration when I've been stuck and frustrated.
  Also thanks to all the copyright holders of the various sounds and images I've used for the game!
